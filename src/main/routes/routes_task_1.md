1. Route is a set of processing steps that are applied to its location message from a destination to a destination. A route usually consists of a series of processing steps that are configured in a linear sequence.
2. This route is written in xml.
3. First, we define that this is a route using the `<route>` tag, which will contain the body of the route.
4. `<description>` — text description of the route.
5. `<from uri=` — where the data is being sent from.    
6. `doTry` and `doCatch` — we wrap it in an exception, in case of an error described in doCatch, we will redirect to other uri.
7. In the `doTry` block, we set the parameters: city, request and GET method.
8. Then we write where we will send the message in `<to uri=`.
9. We specify in the `<unmarshal>` tag in which type we want to convert the data. In this case it is json.
10. In the `when` condition, when the result contains nothing, we throw an exception that the desired location was not found.
11. We set new parameters for the message: request and method.
12. Next, we write `<setBody>` to translate the message. Inside the tag we use the Simple language.
13. We set where we will send this message in `<to uri=`.
14. Next, we specify in which type we want to convert the data.
15. We specify the URI Message Endpoint to send a message in the `toD uri` tag - create a report and send a message with the data about recipient, level and subject.
16. In the `doCatch` tag, in case of an error, we specify the Message Endpoint with the error level, the recipient, and the subject, in which it is written that there is an error.
17. Next, in the `<doFinally>` tag, we write what should happen anyway - the URI for the Message Endpoint with action stop.
